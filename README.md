Customizable Interval Timer
===========================

This is a project that arose out of my wanting to be able to time workout routines specifically and exactly according to my choices. It is a fully customizable timer, allowing for consecutive periods of activity and rest of predetermined lengths. One could easily, for example, specify a workout with any number of back to back alternating "on" and "off" periods. The timer also has the ability to save workouts as LocalStorage on the user's device, for easy access next time. The timer also plays sounds at the start of every interval and the end of the workout, to alert the user that the event has occurred.
